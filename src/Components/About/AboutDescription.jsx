                    <p className="about-founder-text">The best service opportunities are collaborativeâ€”working side by side with others in faith-based, nonprofit, community, and government organizations.

Community service opportunities should enhance the quality of life in the community and assist the poor and needy.

JustServe projects should not have a political or advocacy focus, be for-profit oriented, or directly involve volunteers in fund-raising or other prohibited activities.</p>
